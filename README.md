# Neovim Dotfiles

Hello and welcome. These are my *dotfiles* for [*neovim*](https://neovim.io/).

I created some documentation files you can see below. They are mainly to automate the process of installing and updating *neovim* with all it's dependencies – and my configuration dependencies. Take into account that I like to build *neovim* from source so some requirements are not exactly needed if you install it via *appimage* or a package manager.

Also, take into account I use *neovim* in the *WSL 2* with *Windows 10* using _Debian_ distro, so some steps may not be needed if you don’t use the system as me.

Feel free to use these *dotfiles* for inspiration. :D
